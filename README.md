## ⚡ **If I Built It Today...**  

If I were to recreate this project now, I'd use:  

🚀 **Next.js** instead of CRA for better performance  
🎨 **Tailwind CSS** instead of plain CSS for faster styling  
🌐 **Framer Motion** for more fluid animations  
⚙️ **Redux or Zustand** for better state management  

*(Maybe one day I'll rebuild it... but for now, this stands as a reminder of my growth! 🚀)*
